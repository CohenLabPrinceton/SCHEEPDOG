Repository contains the following:
- Instrumentation wiring diagram for two-axis setup [scheepdog_instrumentation](scheepdog_instrumentation.png)
- MATLAB script for driving two-axis stimulation

Components used in two-axis setup:
- Keithley 2450 source meter
- Keithley 2400 source meter
- Digilent Analog Discovery 2
- Prologix GPIB-USB Controller 6.0 (for GPIB connection b/w computer and Keithley 2400)
